# Chemical Process solutions


Chemical Process solution accelerators from Project Bonsai can help you manage commercial chemical processes and mitigate challenges using AI:

- Control sequence feed quantities
- Minimize the transition time between products
- Optimize energy intensive reactants
- Minimize operational cost and boost resource utilization
- Maximize yield of most valuable refinery products while minimizing energy cost.

AI Agent has a unique ability to help you optimize competing factors for efficiency and efficacy so you can create products in a timely and safe manner.

Exothermic chemical reactions must be tightly controlled to prevent thermal runaway. Control tasks are complicated by the fact that chemical process dynamics are 
nonlinear and reactor states transition from stable to unstable then back to stable as the conversion rate increases.

The Simulink model is based on the Gain scheduled control of a chemical reactor example from Mathworks and replicates a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR). 
The accelerator model can be run as-is or customized to meet your specific process requirements. The Chemical Reactor solution accelerator includes:

- A new workspace created in cloud subscription of your choice.
- A pre-designed, customizable reactor management model in Simulink that provides a virtual environment for the AI Agent to learn in.
- A virtual machine (VM) created under your subscription that you can use to run the simulation model
- Network Interface
- Network Security Group
- Virtual Network
- Public IP Address

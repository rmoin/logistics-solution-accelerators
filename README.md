# Logistics Solution Accelerators
A solution accelerator is a set of artifacts and templates for a pre-built, customizable solutions to common problems. Start training an agent immediately or use the accelerator as a learning tool before building a custom logistics solution from scratch.

## How do Solution Accelerators work?
Solution accelerators are designed to solve specific logistics optimization problems and provide all the components necessary for a custom reinforced learning solution:
- A new workspace created in the cloud subscription of your choice.
- A pre-designed, customizable simulation model that provides a virtual environment for the AI Agent to learn in.
- A virtual machine (VM) created under your cloud subscription that you can use to run a simulation model.
- A Jupyter Notebook designed to build AI Agent to solve the associated optimization problem.
- Assess trained AI Agent
- Export AI Agent & explore predictions

Solution accelerators are also fully customizable so you can tailor the simulator and Jupyter Notebook to your unique business needs and systems.

## Supported industries and use cases
Solution accelerators are categorized according to the associated industry segment. Accelerators with the potential for cross-industry application are included under all relevant industries. 

## Deep Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning algorithms are able to understand and respond to dynamic environments, and their decisions can be game-changing for businesses operating complex distribution networks.
